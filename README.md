Builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/) YAML
files.

* custom folding for JJB YAML files

## Basic Usage

To avoid conflicting with regular YAML files, the plugin defines a new
file type, "jjb\_yaml".  All customisations are applied to this file
type.

Currently, it is up to the user to set this file type appropriately.

## Basic Configuration

At the moment, the plugin doesn't provide any configuration options.

## Installation

This repo should be compatible with your favourite vim plugin
installation method.
